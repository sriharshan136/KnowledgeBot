Since 1975, The Nephrology Group, Inc. has been dedicated to providing high-quality nephrology services across Central California. What began with one physician’s commitment to kidney health has grown into a leading provider group, bringing together skilled nephrologists, nurse practitioners, renal dietitians, and nurse educators to offer a full spectrum of care.
We’re proud to serve our community with a patient-centered approach that prioritizes wellness, innovation, and excellence in every aspect of kidney care.
